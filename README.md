## Introduction

We present MEGA-Bench, an evaluation suite that scales multimodal evaluation to over 500 real-world tasks, to address the highly heterogeneous daily use cases of end users. Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation.

Key features of MEGA-Bench:

- 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators
- Wide range of output formats including numbers, phrases, code, LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc.
- Over 40 metrics developed to evaluate these diverse tasks
- Fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill)
- Interactive visualization of model capabilities

Unlike existing benchmarks that unify problems into standard multi-choice questions, MEGA-Bench embraces the diversity of real-world tasks and their output formats. This allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of vision-language models across various dimensions.

## Dataset

The MEGA-Bench dataset is now available on the Hugging Face. You can access it at:

## Evaluation

[Evaluation code and instructions will be added once released]
